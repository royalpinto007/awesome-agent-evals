# Awesome Agent Evals [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](#contributing)

> A curated, **auto-updating** list of tools, frameworks, benchmarks, and ideas for **evaluating AI agents** — knowing whether your agent actually works, and whether it still works tomorrow.

Anyone can demo an agent in five minutes. The hard part is knowing it does the right thing on the inputs you didn't try, and catching the moment a prompt tweak, model bump, or new tool quietly makes it worse. Agents fail differently from plain LLM calls — they take multi-step **trajectories**, call **tools**, keep **state**, and a small early mistake compounds into a wrong final action. Evaluating them needs more than "eyeball the output."

## Start Here: How to Think About Agent Evals

A quick mental model so the tools below make sense.

**1. Outcome vs. trajectory.**
- *Outcome eval* asks: was the final answer/action correct? (Did it book the right flight?)
- *Trajectory eval* asks: were the intermediate steps right? (Did it call the tools in a sane order, not hallucinate an argument, not loop?)
- Agents need both. A right answer reached by luck through a broken path will break on the next input.

**2. Offline vs. online.**
- *Offline* — run a fixed test set in CI before you ship. Repeatable, gates regressions.
- *Online* — measure real traffic in production (traces, user signals, live guardrails). Catches what your test set didn't imagine.

**3. How you score.**
- *Deterministic checks* — exact match, regex, "did the tool get called", schema/JSON validity, task completed. Cheap and reliable; use them wherever you can.
- *LLM-as-judge* — a model grades the output against a rubric. Flexible for open-ended answers, but the judge itself needs validating (bias, position effects) or you're measuring noise.
- *Human review* — the ground truth you calibrate the others against. Expensive; spend it on a small gold set.

**4. The metrics people actually track.**
Task success rate, tool-call accuracy, faithfulness/groundedness (for RAG), safety/guardrail violations, cost per task, latency (p50/p95/p99), and **regression delta** — did this change make it worse than last week?

**5. The one rule.** A metric you can game in isolation is worthless. Recall means nothing without a leak/precision counterpart; a 0% failure rate means nothing if you never tested a hard case. Pair your metrics, and keep a gold set you trust.
